                      The official <a href="https://en.tankiwiki.com/Ratings_and_Statistics">Tanki Wiki</a> states "Efficiency/Effectiveness Rating - This is calculated using a complicated formula that reflects how effective you are in battles. There is a separate section that shows the Top 100 players efficiency-wise. […] Please note that the formula used to calculate efficiency/effectiveness has not been disclosed by the Developers."

                      How to Play Optimally for Top 100 Efficiency
Efficiency rating is determined by objective-focused gameplay. From Rank 1 through Rank 31 (Legend), players receive a flat 3,000 efficiency points per rank, provided two conditions are met: a minimum 2.0 K/D and a crystal-to-experience (C/E) ratio of 1.0 or higher. If your C/E ratio drops below 1.0, the rank bonus is reduced (typically to ~2,500–2,800). After Rank 31, the flat bonus no longer applies.

Optimal Modes and Maps

The most efficient gameplay occurs on large maps with high player counts, maximizing battle activity and battle fund.

Mode priority:

Siege – Capturing points yields the best ratio: 50 battle score for 15 experience.

Rugby – Objective play grants 80 battle score for 30 experience. You can deliver up to 7 balls per match.

Capture the Flag – Similar efficiency to Rugby, but capped at 5 flag captures, making it slightly less optimal.

Required Performance Metrics

To realistically compete for the Top 100, you must maintain:

2.0+ Kill/Death ratio

2.2+ Crystal/Experience ratio

Consistent objective play, not passive farming

Why This Works (Context)

If you examine recent Top 100 lists, you will notice very few changes since 2021. The reason lies in two key updates:

Patch #794 (March 28, 2025): Experience gains were reduced by 25% (e.g., 40 → 30 XP, 20 → 15 XP), improving efficiency for objective-based play.

Patch #800 (May 27, 2025): Premium Pass crystal gains increased from +100% to +150%, dramatically boosting C/E ratios.

Final Requirements Summary

100% Premium Pass uptime

Mode priority: Siege > Rugby > CTF

Minimum 2.0 K/D

Minimum 2.2 C/E
