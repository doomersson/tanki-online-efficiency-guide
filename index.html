      <section>
        <p>
          This guide explains how the efficiency system works and outlines the
          optimal way to compete for a Top 100 efficiency rating.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What Is Efficiency?</h2>
        <p>
          According to the official
          <a href="https://en.tankiwiki.com/Ratings_and_Statistics">Tanki Wiki</a>,
          efficiency (also called effectiveness) is calculated using a
          non-disclosed formula that reflects how effective a player is in
          battles. A separate leaderboard tracks the Top 100 players by
          efficiency.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Rank Bonuses</h2>
        <p>
          From <strong>Rank 1 to Rank 31 (Legend)</strong>, players gain a flat
          <strong>3,000 efficiency points per rank</strong> as long as the
          following conditions are met:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Minimum 2.0 Kill/Death ratio</li>
          <li>Crystal/Experience (C/E) ratio of 1.0 or higher</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If your C/E ratio drops below 1.0, the bonus is reduced (typically
          2,500-2,800). After Rank 31, the flat rank bonus no longer applies.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Optimal Modes and Maps</h2>
        <p>
          The most efficient gameplay happens on large maps with many players,
          maximizing battle activity and battle fund.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Siege</strong> - 50 battle score for 15 experience</li>
          <li><strong>Rugby</strong> - 80 battle score for 30 experience (up to 7 deliveries)</li>
          <li><strong>Capture the Flag</strong> - Similar to Rugby, capped at 5 flags</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Why the Leaderboard Barely Changes And Why It's Changing Now</h2>
        <p>
          The Top 100 list has remained mostly unchanged since 2021 due to experience inflation we used to have. This was intentional so you would rank up faster and have weaker
          equipment. But it changed thanks to these recent patches:
